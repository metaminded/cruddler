h1. Cruddler - CRUD admin controllers for lazy programmers

NOTE: This is currently in in-house-testing-and-developing state. Feel free to use, but don't complain if it doesn't fit your needs. Feedback is welcome, though.

h2. Mission Objective

I was sick of implementing edit, show, index, ... actions over and over again, and wasn't too enthusiastic about resource_controller and the like for they are way to overengineered.

The same annoyance I found in implementing the corresponding view.

And now, Rails 3.1 is there with view inheritance.

h2. Controller

just write

<pre>
  cruddler :all
</pre>

into your controller, or replace <tt>:all</tt> with a list of the actions you want to generate. 

If the class can't be guessed from the controller name, pass a <tt>:class => MyClass</tt> option.

If the current resource is nested, pass <tt>:nested => :master_model</tt>, deep nesting is about to come.

h2. Views

Just implement <tt>_model_name</tt> and <tt>_listing</tt> partials, the rest is done magically. If your edit or new actions need to be more specific, you can override with <tt>_edit_model_name</tt> or <tt>_new_model_name</tt>.

h3. Other, new bugs

There are roughly another 997 bugs in Tabulatr, although we do some testing (see <tt>spec/</tt>). So if you hunt them, please let me know using the <a href="https://github.com/provideal/tabulatr/issues">GitHub Bugtracker</a>.

h2. Contributing to tabulatr

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the <a href="https://github.com/provideal/tabulatr/issues">issue tracker</a> to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
* Feel free to send a pull request if you think others (me, for example) would like to have your change incorporated into future versions of tabulatr.
